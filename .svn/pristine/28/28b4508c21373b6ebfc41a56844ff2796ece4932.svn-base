    <description>The body of the Dark Lord crumbles to dust before you, leaving only the magic stone that serves as the key to the room in which the princess is imprisoned. You open the door and find the princess lying on a decrepit bed. As you rush over to the bedside, she opens her eyes and smiles weakly. "I was beginning to lose hope," she says. "I feared his blight would hang over this land forever. Now with Abaddon gone, perhaps this land will live again." ---------------Abaddon is defeated, and you have rescued the princess. Your quest is at an end. ---------------The End. Thanks for playing! </description>
